# k-scratch

This is a WIP - please provide feedback!

K-Scratch allows you to pull down your Azure functions for local editing. File monitoring immediatly re-uploads changes to Azure when you save. Local log stream allows you to see what's going on as your function compiles and runs. 

It's probably best not to use this on your prod functions :)
